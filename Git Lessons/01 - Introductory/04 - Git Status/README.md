# 04 - Git Status

The purpose for this lesson is to get you at an introductory level of understanding about Git. 

A few things to note:
1. This assignment, and future assignments will contain a few tasks that will outline the goal of the assignment.
2. You will be expected to use outside help (Google, Bing, AskJeeves, StackOverflow, etc.), PowerShell's built in "Get-Help" or Get-Command", or any method you can think of.
3. Always feel free to reach out to a team member if something does not make sense.
4. Feedback is always encouraged!
5. Try not to copy and paste code snippets, type it out to build muscle memory!

## Pre-requisites:
1. You must have Git installed on your local machine
   1. [Git Installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Assignment for lesson 4:
1. After you clone a repository or make a change, you can check the status on your repository
   1. Run `git status` in the directory that was initialized as a Git repository
   2. You should either see that your branch is up to date
   3. Now, make a change to any file in the directory, save it, and then run `git status` again
      1. Compare the output to the first time you ran `git status` to the one you ran after you made a change
